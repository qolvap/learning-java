/*
 * Class and Package Structure:
 *
 * Classes: Java utilizes classes to organize code. Classes define objects and their behavior.
 * Packages: Packages are a way to organize classes into logical groups. They help avoid naming conflicts and facilitate project management.
 *
 * Naming Conventions:
 *
 * Class Names: Class names should reflect their purpose. They should start with a capital letter, and words should be separated by camel case (e.g., MyClass).
 * Package Names: Package names should be unique and related to functionality. They are typically written in reverse order of the company's domain (e.g., com.company.project).
 *
 * Creating the Main Method:
 *
 * Main Method: Every Java program has an entry point, which is defined by the main method. This method is called when the program is executed.
 *
 * Outputting Text:
 *
 * Using System.out.println(): This method outputs text to the console. It allows you to display information to the user during program execution.
 *
 * Using Tabbing and Special Characters:
 *
 * Tabbing: Tabbing is used to align code and improve readability. It can be used for program structuring.
 * Special Characters: Java supports various special characters, such as \n (newline) and \t (tab), which are used for formatting output text.
